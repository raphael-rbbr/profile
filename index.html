          <p> I'm a young programmer (only in the legal sense as inside I'm already 50) embarking on the exciting world of web development. As all of my fellow humans, I enjoy a variety of hobs such as: playing video games (been doing for as long as I can remember), playing RPG (not the medical treatment for chronic back pain) and some sports.   </p>
        <p> <br>You can be a part of this world as well! <br><br>Just click on the link below and you will have the necessary knowledge to program  as well!!</p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>The RPG of jobs! The endless possibilities! The level of frustration only encounter in games from FromSoftware (git gud)! Receiving a problem to solve with no order or guide lines you must obey. The free reins of a sandbox game where your missions is to code. Also, can be quite infuriating as a typo may spell the end of your program (pun intended). </p>

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>A classic of brazilian culture, the famous pelada(naked), a friendly football(the real one, not that disgrace played in the U.S) match among friends on a weekly basis. <br> Other than that there's also another  brazilian clich√©, training jiu-jits (brazilian jiu-jitsu for those not form Brazil). </p>

        <h2>RPG</h2>
        <p>By my description of programming you might have realized I enjoy playing RPG`s. My preferred system is Pathfinder, you can do literally anything (not exaggerating) there are rules for almost every imaginable actions, and when there isn't one, you just make one! Also, don't forget to make a event out of it, my table for example always takes a day, we prepare our lunch, get snacks, and beers.</p>
